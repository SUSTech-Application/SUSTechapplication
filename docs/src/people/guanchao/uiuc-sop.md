Computers are magical but not magic. That is what Professor Peter Bui told me
in the Systems Programming course. I have been studying, working, and hacking
hard to comprehend how the seemingly magical box works, and now, it comes to
the point where I would like to embark on graduate study, hopefully at UIUC, to
further pursue a Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering and to
set forth to discover the principles underneath the magic of computers.

## My preparation for graduate study

With the courses listed in my CV, my hybrid background in both Microelectronics
and Computer Science and Engineering helps me to understand the principles of
computer hardware and how to design software systems to stretch the available
resources to the most.

I participated in a summer research program at the University of Notre Dame
after my exchange semester there, during which I worked with Professor Douglas
Thain. More details can be found in my CV. Prof. Thain impressed me with his
sharp insights into sophisticated systems, and our senior software engineer,
Benjamin Tovar, astounded me with his proficiency in multiple technology
stacks. They galvanized me to pursue an advanced degree to become a person like
them.

In addition, I am also the founder and moderator of the Python User Group in
SUSTech. I have gained substantial experience in searching and experimenting to
help others with technical issues. I am now eager to understand those questions
as a scientist or engineer, beyond simply being a power user, and I believe
pursuing an advanced degree is the way out.

## My intellectual interests and scholarly questions

Throughout my study for electrical engineering and computer science and
engineering, in the big picture, I found myself particularly interested in:

- Thinking about the relations between the pervasive discrete objects in the
    world.
- Finding isomorphism across multiple disciplines, for example, the
    mathematics behind music and graph data structure underneath politics and
    social networks.
- Designing systems that work well and look cool, as if putting LEGO bricks
    together.
- Most importantly, understanding the magic behind the ubiquitous black boxes
    collectively called computers nowadays.

These macroscopic intellectual interests crystallize into the following
scholarly questions that I am interested in exploring in the graduate study:

- How to design distributed/parallel computing systems to support the
    escalating demand from industry and researchers?
- How do programming languages work? What are the details that provide the
    features we took for granted?
- How do computers work from a systems programming level?

I am also intrigued by the role that computer technologies play in modern
society, and how can we utilize them to benefit our community.

## Faculty members I would like to work with

After a brief search for faculties in the ECE department using my interested
areas as keywords, I found the research focus of these (and more) professors
align with mine:

- Daniel S Katz - Distributed/Parallel computing
- Sayan Mitra - Distributed systems, programming languages
- Steven Lumetta - Software system, parallel computing, computer architecture
- Indranil Gupta - Distributed systems

## How this program helps me to achieve my goals

As mentioned in the previous section, I have a strong aspiration to understand
the in-depth principles and ideas behind electrical and computer engineering,
and I believe this program at UIUC provides me with a great opportunity to
explore more. Interest and curiosity are my primary motivations for attending
graduate school.

This program also helps me in seeking employment. Being a new grad from UIUC
certainly makes my resume more appealing to employers, however, the
professional training and experiences at UIUC are what I consider the most
valuable, if not invaluable. I believe that to succeed in this prosperous and
ever-changing field in the long run, extensive and intensive understanding is
required, rather than simply being able to tinker with a breadboard or write a
Python script. I would like to quote one of my Professors: "Salary itself is
not enough to change your life, it's the people you work with that really
matters".

In addition, this program enables me to delve into research in different areas
to see where my research interest is, or maybe not be used to the lifestyle of
researchers at all. Once I have more insights into my career development and if
I still wish to further pursue a PhD's degree in the future, I may continue to
do so at UIUC with the faculties I am familiar with.

## My experience at the University of Notre Dame

I would like to emphasize my experience as an exchange student at the
University of Notre Dame. It was my first time in the US, but I was surprised
by how fast I got used to the new culture. Taking the classroom for example, in
China, students tend not to raise or answer questions in class, though I do it
a lot. In the US, however, things are completely opposite and I felt myself
resonate with the lecturers as I have never been. Office hours are a new thing
for me, and I utilized them to ask more questions within and beyond the course.
Two of my course instructors then became my recommenders.

Outside of the classroom, I also developed friendships with both domestic and
international students. I was a chef at the pizza kitchen in my residential
hall, and I found serving my guests delicious pizza and chatting with them more
than pleasing.

I consider my passion and capabilities for studying new things and tinkering
with them as my key competence, and my experience of living and studying in a
US college makes me confident that I will succeed in a graduate program at
UIUC.
