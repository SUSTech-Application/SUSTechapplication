## 概述

APS证书作为德国高校录取中国学生的前提条件之一，可能会是德国留学申请者的第一个拦路虎，但相信我，只要你平时有学习专业课（期末考前学也是学），听力口语能达到沟通交流的程度都无需太担心。

看到这篇的同学应该已经对APS的内容和作用有了大致的了解，如果尚无，推荐阅读这篇文章扫盲↓

[**“研究生留学德国：APS审核指南 (2024)”**](https://www.mygermanuniversity.com/zh/articles/APS-China-for-Master%E2%80%99s-applications)

首先放个官网链接：[德国驻华大使馆文化处留德人员审核部](https://www.aps.org.cn/zh/)，申请所需材料以及注意事项包括官方联系方式都可以在此找到，建议优先查阅已列举的常见问题↓，如果仍有不确定的疑问不要犹豫请直接（附上注册号）邮件联系。

![1-常见问题.png](1-常见问题.png)

接下来我将主要作为南科大CS专业学生简述我的APS申请及准备过程，主要涵盖时间线，材料准备，专业复习等

## 申请流程

申请步骤如官网所述：

![2-申请步骤.png](2-申请步骤.png)

时间线如下：

10/25 开始准备材料

11/03 快递寄出

11/04 签收材料

11/24 要求补交小学毕业证明（广东省九年义务教育证的时间不完整，未涵盖小学六年）

11/28 完成材料审核，开始排队面试

12/06 通知12/19上午8点面试

12/20 查到结果，”gut” 通过！

总的来说花了大约2个月左右的时间从开始准备到最终通过，当然，推荐有德国申请意向（注意比利时鲁汶大学在申请时无需APS但办理签证时需要）在完成六个学期课业后尽早开始准备。早点开始还有个好处是成绩单涵盖课程较少则询问范围也少，并且脑袋里的知识还新鲜。

## 材料准备

所需材料见官方文件规定：[www.aps.org.cn](https://www.aps.org.cn/wp-content/uploads/211_merkblatt_verfahren_china_interview_chn.pdf)

![](3-审核面谈-page1.jpg)

![3-审核面谈-page2](3-审核面谈-page2.jpg)

![3-审核面谈-page3](3-审核面谈-page3.jpg)

针对在读生的材料清单中的具体操作如下：

1. 汇款单复印件可选择银行转账后生成的电子回单

2. 若小学或初中毕业照丢失选择义务教育证替代，需保证证书上完整涵盖九年的上学时间，否则将被要求补交。补交方式如下：

   ![4-补交义务证明.png](4-补交义务证明.png)

3. 高中毕业证的公证翻译图省事可通过淘宝花费两三百需3-5个工作日完成，有学姐推荐自己翻译后找高中校长签名+盖学校章可免费达到同样效果
4. 大学录取花名册在我校是前往风雨操场二楼的招生办找韩少亮老师通过查阅入学时间+省份获得中文复印件，在此之后韩老师会发送一份英文的花名册模板，回去对照填写后打印带回给韩老师盖章即可
5. 在校生通过事务中心自助机打印在读证明和成绩单双语版后可前往南科大中心3楼教工部找老师盖章后用提供的信封自行密封

## 专业复习

面谈包括笔试和面试，笔试基本为基于专业基础知识的五道问答题，较为简单，约二十分钟完成，提供词典。面试首先需要你简单自我介绍，这里可以提及自身专业背景并说明德国目标申请院校，接着对着你的成绩单标注一些课程并逐个提问课程内容，大多为大二大三所学的专业课，少量面试官感兴趣的人文社科选修，可以在擅长的课程中讲解详细一些以拖时间。成绩单上分数特别高或特别低的课被提问的可能性较大。

我认为复习后只要能做到大部分课程可以口头列举几个知识点并以科普性质讲解三分钟则基本能通过。个人仅大致浏览课程大纲总结少量笔记共复习两三天就参加面试了，当场面试同学裸考的也有不少，课程知识不会问得特别深入，大四上的我已经把高数大物概统线代等忘光光了，实际也没有询问这类基础课程无需太过担忧。

附上我当时一边准备课程描述一边胡乱总结的知识点（供CS专业同学参考

（另外可能大家不太清楚但我们学校教工部有提供课程描述官网，可以作为复习参考以及欧陆申请中制作课程描述的重要指南：https://course-tao.sustech.edu.cn/kcxxweb/queryKcxxwebListChinesePC

## CS Major Review for APS

  - Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis
    - Introduction
      - This course will teach students the fundamentals of data organization, storage and processing in computer science. Students will be required to grasp why and how a data structure can be applied according to applications.
      - In this course, we will study the data structures (fundamental and advanced data structures), algorithms analysis and algorithm design methodology (generic and specific algorithm design techniques). Such knowledge is at the core of computer science, and allows us to write faster programs, especially ones whose running time has attractive worst-case bounds. Techniques for analyzing the performance of algorithms, designing beautiful/efficient algorithm will also be discussed in detail. Tentative topics to be covered include array, linked list, queue, stack, searching in ordered lists, sorting, priority queues, binary search trees, graph algorithms, finite state machine, and so on.
    - Main concepts (or themes)
      - Structures
        - **List**: In computer science, a list is a collection of elements that can be accessed in a sequence. Lists can be either **arrays**, where elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, or **linked lists**, where each element contains a reference (or link) to the next element in the sequence. Lists are versatile and can be used to **implement various data structures**, including stacks and queues, but unlike these structures, lists do not restrict the insertion and removal of elements to specific locations.
        - **Queue**: A linear structure following a First In, First Out (**FIFO**) order. Elements are added at one end and removed from the other, like a line of people.
        - **Heap**: A **tree-based** structure where each node is ordered according to a **comparison** property (e.g., in a max heap, each parent node is greater than its children). Used in priority queues and heap sort.
        - **Stack**: A linear structure following a Last In, First Out (**LIFO**) order. Elements are added and removed from the same end, like a stack of plates.
        - **Tree**: A **hierarchical** structure with a single **root** element and **nodes** having a **parent-child relationship**. Used in many algorithms and data retrieval processes.
        - **Graph**: A graph is a structure consisting of **nodes** (also called vertices) and **edges** connecting these nodes. Graphs are used to represent networks, where nodes represent **entities** and edges represent **connections** or relationships between these entities. Graphs can be **directed or undirected**, indicating whether the relationships have a specific direction.
      - Algorithm
        - **Sorting**: Sorting involves arranging data in a **particular order** (ascending or descending). Examples include algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, and BubbleSort, each with unique efficiencies.
        - **Pathfinding**: Pathfinding algorithms find the **shortest path** or evaluate available paths in a graph or grid. Used in GPS navigation and games. **BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra’s algorithm** are common examples.
        - **Greedy**: Greedy algorithms make the **optimal choice at each step**, aiming for a **local optimum**. Used in problems like the coin change problem, where the goal is to minimize the number of coins for a given value.
        - **Divide and Conquer**: This approach divides a problem into **smaller**, more manageable **sub-problems**, solves them **independently**, and **combines** their solutions. QuickSort and MergeSort are examples, where a list is divided and sorted in parts.

      - BIO102B is an introductory/discovery course for freshmen (but not limited to) to understand biology through laying out some major modern-day issues that we and other species of the planet have been facing. In the past half century, the biological and biomedical research represents an actively evolved rapidly progressed scientific field to expand and somehow to quick subvert traditional and contemporary knowledge of life. The course is thus intended to explain why the field is challenging and requires an enormous effort of inter-disciplines (including but not restricted to the chemistry, physics, mathematics, medicine, computer science, health science and material science) and why biotech and biomedical research has been heavily invested in developed countries around the world. Unlike the stereotype of biology course, i.e., applying a few theorems or rules and memorizing lots of names, terms and facts, BIO102B would guide the students to experience a new learning journey of life science, and to cherish, revere and appreciate life more.
      - BIO102B offers an introductory approach to biology for freshmen and others interested. The course explores pressing contemporary biological issues and the rapid evolution of the field, transcending traditional knowledge. It emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of biology, involving chemistry, physics, mathematics, medicine, computer science, health science, and material science. BIO102B highlights the substantial global investments in biotech and biomedical research. Unlike typical biology courses focused on memorization, it encourages students to embark on a dynamic learning journey, fostering a deeper appreciation for life and its complexities. This course aims to instill a profound respect for the science of life.

    - Introduction
      - This course give a fundamental introduction to Chinese Information Processing (CIP), including: 1. the nature and history of CIP; 2.the fundamental principle of CIP, like corpus, matching, rules, statistics, and corpus annotation; 3. frequently-used tools, corpora and how to use them. We’ll do some computer programming in this course, so it is easier for students who have enough knowledge on programming. However, the programming tasks in this course are too easy to worry about for most students.
